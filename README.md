# Assembly-Introduction

Welcome to the **Assembly-Introduction** repository! ðŸŽ‰

This repo contains all the code examples and exercises featured in my YouTube video series, where I dive deep into the fundamentals of computer science â€” from the basics of bitwise operations to how computers communicate with each other at the lowest level.

## What you'll find here

- Step-by-step tutorials covering:
  - Binary and bit manipulation
  - Low-level mathematical operations
  - Assembly language basics
  - Computer architecture fundamentals
  - Networking principles at the machine level

- Practical examples to reinforce the theory

- Easy-to-understand explanations both in code and in my videos
